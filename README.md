Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour.

We can follow a systematic process to address the challenge of anomaly detection. We can begin by collecting and preparing transaction data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Then, we can find patterns in the data to find anomalies and use specialized anomaly detection algorithms like isolation forest to detect anomalies.
